# dMRI-subsampling_sims

This script performs Monte-Carlo simulations of a single-voxel representative of white-matter tissue. Diffusion-weighted signals are simulated and subsampled; and Rician noise is added to achieve different SNR levels. Then, diffusion parameters are estimated: FA, MD, AD, RD, MK, AK and RK.
